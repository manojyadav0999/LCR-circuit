# LCR Circuit Project 🔄⚡

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates the working of an **LCR (Inductor-Capacitor-Resistor)** circuit using an interactive simulation hosted at [Falstad Circuit Simulator](https://tinyurl.com/2xxajh8p). The simulation allows you to observe real-time behavior of current, voltage, and resonance in the circuit.

## 🧪 Components Used

- **Inductor (L)** – Simulates magnetic energy storage.
- **Capacitor (C)** – Stores energy in the electric field.
- **Resistor (R)** – Dissipates energy as heat.
- **AC Voltage Source** – Drives alternating current through the circuit.
- **Ground and Wires** – For circuit completion and connection.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

- **Resonance**: Occurs when inductive and capacitive reactances cancel each other.
- **Impedance (Z)**: Total opposition to AC, varies with frequency.
- **Phase Shift**: The lag or lead between voltage and current waveforms.
- **Energy Exchange**: Between capacitor and inductor in oscillating circuits.


## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Understand how LCR circuits respond to AC signals.
- Observe the condition of resonance and its effect on current.
- Learn about damping, Q-factor, and impedance in reactive circuits.

## 📌 Notes

- Try changing frequency to find **resonant frequency**.
- Observe voltage across each component at different frequencies.
- See how the **phase angle** between voltage and current changes.
